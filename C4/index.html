    <h1>WorldSkills</h1>

    <p>WorldSkills organises the world championships of vocational skills, and is held every two years in different parts of the world. The organisation, which also hosts conferences about vocational skills, describes itself as the global hub for skills.</p>
    <p>WorldSkills brings together young people, industry, government, education, and institutions, to promote the benefits of and need for skilled trade professionals. The aims of the competition include demonstrating the advantages of learning a vocational skill, and encouraging 'parity of esteem' between vocational and academic qualifications.</p>

    <p>The city of Kazan, Russia, hosted the 45th WorldSkills Competition in 2019.</p>
    <p>At the previous event, WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017, there were competitions in 51 skills areas with close to 1,300 young people taking part. WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017, took place between 15 and 18 October 2017 at Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.</p>

    <p>WorldSkills currently has 85 Member countries and regions, most of which organise national skills competitions that help to prepare the workforce and talent of today for the jobs of the future.</p>

    <p>WorldSkills International, formerly known as the International Vocation Training Organisation (IVTO), was founded in the 1940s and emerged from a desire to create new employment opportunities for young people in some of the economies that were devastated by the Second World War.</p>
